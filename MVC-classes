### Model-View-Controller Scheme

The intent is to seperate concerns into three modules:
#### Model
The model will contain the information that will eventually be seen in view.

Attributes will include: 
Logical Memory contents
Page Table contents
Physical Memory contents
Any other data

Methods will include:
A constructor
A decode function which takes the string that was sent by the FPGA, and uses it to set the above attributes.
Get functions for all attributes

#### View
View will contain all code involving visuals and user interface

Attributes will include:
A Constructor
A Controller object
An instance of the Qt GUI

Methods will include:
All UI events 

#### Controller
Controller will handle interaction between Model, View, and I/O. 

Attributes will include:
A Model (as an instantion argument)
A View

Methods will include:
A Constructor
Get methods for all Model attributes
Reset Model
